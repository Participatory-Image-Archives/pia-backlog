# PIA backlog and use cases

## Participatory Knowledge Practices in Analogue and Digital Image Archives (PIA)

Public repository for documenting stories and use cases for the _Participatory Knowledge Practices in Analogue and Digital Image Archives_ (PIA) project funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF). 

PIA aims to design a visual interface with machine learning-based tools to make it easy to annotate, contextualise, organise, and link both images and their metadata from three collections (Atlas der Schweizerischen Volkskunde, Familie Kreis, Ernst Brunner) of the _Swiss Society for Folklore Studies / Schweizerische Gesellschaft fuÌˆr Volkskunde (SSFS/SGV)_, to deliberately encourage the participatory use of archives.

There are two main goals:

1. Conducting a systematic analysis and description of the analogue and digital photo archives
2. Designing a participatory image archive

In a series of workshops and interviews with both academic and non-academic users, along with archivists and database specialists, the project will analyse the new demands of digital (and process-oriented) knowledge production in order to achieve these goals.

## Purpose

All new features, bugs, feature requests will be curated in this repo. We will use the issues created here to flesh out features, designs, and requirements.

What happens here, doesn't stay here

- The issues reported in this repo will be worked on in other PIA repositories.
- Issues created in #pia-backlog will serve as parent issues that track all information about that request.
- All external documents or issues created in other repos must be linked back to issues created in this repo.
- We're implementing this system so that we can have complete transparency around our product developement process.

## Contributing

The contribution should be made by creating [issues](https://github.com/Participatory-Image-Archives/pia-stories/issues) via the template (which can be extended) and by associating them with relevant labels. Issues are closed either when an implementation has been completed or when they could not be carried out within the project timeframe (February 2021 - January 2025).
