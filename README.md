# pia-stories
Public repository for documenting stories and use cases for the _Participatory Knowledge Practices in Analogue and Digital Image Archives_ (PIA) project. 

PIA aims to design a visual interface with machine learning-based tools to make it easy to annotate, contextualise, organise, and link both images and their metadata from three collections of the Swiss _Society for Folklore Studies / Schweizerische Gesellschaft fuÌˆr Volkskunde (SSFS/SGV)_, to deliberately encourage the participatory use of archives.

The contribution should be made by creating [issues](https://github.com/Participatory-Image-Archives/pia-stories/issues) via the template (which can be extended) and by associating them with relevant labels. Issues are closed either when an implementation has been completed or when they could not be carried out within the project timeframe (February 2021 - January 2025).
