# pia-stories
Public repository for documenting stories and use cases for the _Partizipative Wissenspraktiken in analogen und digitalen Bildarchiven / Participatory Knowledge Practices in Analogue and Digital Image Archives_ (PIA) project. 

The contribution should be made by creating [issues](https://github.com/Participatory-Image-Archives/pia-stories/issues) via the template (which can be extended) and by associating them with relevant labels. Issues are closed either when an implementation has been completed or when they could not be carried out within the project timeframe (February 2021 - January 2025).
